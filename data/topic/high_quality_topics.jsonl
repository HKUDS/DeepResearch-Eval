The research approach combines the antibacterial performance of quaternary ammonium salts (stemming from the cationic ammonium centers) with the bacterial photobiological inactivation triggered by porphyrin as a photosensitizer (aPDT). The proposed novel cationic porphyrin is designed to serve as a potential photosensitizer for aPDT, capable of eliminating microorganisms under light exposure and exhibiting antibacterial effects in dark conditions due to the characteristics of quaternary ammonium salts. This material can be used for treating bacterial surfaces."}
