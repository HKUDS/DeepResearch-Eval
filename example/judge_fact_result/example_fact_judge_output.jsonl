While it discusses 'noise at the sensor site' and factors such as wave refractions, reflections, and superimpositions influencing the analysis, the specific terms and occurrences mentioned in the provided sentence are not addressed."}}

Only P-waves radiate from a purely isotropic source. A positive isotropic component is an expansion/explosion... A negative isotropic component is a contraction/implosion.' This supports the assertion about a non-zero isotropic component indicating a volume change and identifying explosion (positive) or implosion (negative)."}}
